This is the start of a clothing store, it uses another project called keycloak for the authentication and user manaagement. 

As per the package naming, original fork was from a Baeldung project that had a completely different model domain.

This store was created using JAVA 13 and a in memory DB. This project was not finished and was completed after 2 years experieince in JAVA.
